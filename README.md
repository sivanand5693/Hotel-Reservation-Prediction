# Hotel-Reservation-Prediction

The goal for this project is to use machine learning techniques and algorithms to develop a good prediction model for hotel cancellations. The data set is named hotel booking demand and can be found in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand. The data set includes approximately 120,000 samples with 32 features. Some of the features included are number of adults, number of children, number of weeknights booked by the guest, if they are a repeated guest, etc. We will be taking the reservation status as our labels because that is what we will attempt to predict. This variable has three categories namely: Check-Out, Cancelled, No-Show. Thus, we have a multiclass classification problem. The remaining features may be transformed to a numerical representation depending on the algorithm run.
